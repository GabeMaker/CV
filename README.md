# Gabriel Arafa

I'm a junior software developer passionate about continuous learning and collaboration. After 5 years working as an emergency medical dispatcher for the London Ambulance Service, I decided I wanted to try my hand at coding. I've always enjoyed problem solving and the development world struck me as a good place to find exciting and fulfilling work. Having recently graduated from a web development course, I am improving my skills while working as a volunteer developer at Cancer Research UK in London.

## Skills

|       |          |  
|:-------------:|:-------------| 
| **Software Craftsmanship**      |I graduated from Makers Academy, a 12-week bootcamp where I learned the fundamentals of web development. The course placed constant emphasis on Agile methods, Test-driven Development and clean, elegant code. Through project work and support from coaches and other students, I have developed a solid understanding of these concepts and am committed to continuously improving my skills according to best practice.| 
| **Teamwork and Communication**      |Extensive experience of pair programming with a wide variety of developers. I worked in teams of 4-5 students on several projects at Makers Academy, participating in daily stand-ups and regular retrospectives and using Kanban and other methods for sharing and prioritising work. While volunteering at Cancer Research UK, I have gained an understanding of how development teams operate in large organisations and have participated in scrum team planning for 2-week development sprints and a cross-team retrospective where new features were demonstrated.| 
| **Rapid, Independent Learning** |In a very short time I have grown an initial interest in technology and problem solving into an effective and flexible skill set, suitable for a role as a junior developer. At Makers Academy, I worked on projects with peers during the week, sharing ideas and accelerating our learning through pair-programming. I demonstrated understanding of key concepts and techniques by completing independent weekend challenge projects. I adapt to new technologies quickly and I am confident in using web resources alongside the support of colleagues and my wider network to gain further understanding when needed.|
| **Resilience and Working Under Pressure** |Successfully completed a highly-intensive bootcamp. I worked 60+ hours per week and managed the challenge of a steep learning curve and frenetic environment. 5 years of experience working 12-hour shifts (often 6 in a row) in the London Ambulance Service control room, making critical decisions with limited resources in order to help people in danger and/or distress.|
| **Delivering Value for Clients** |For our final project, our team worked with an external client - the Stemettes charity - to develop a user-engagement app. Working from their initial pitch, we produced wireframe models of our vision for their product, refining these after regular meetings with stakeholders. We responded to new ideas, changing demands and technological limitations, delivering a solution that our client loved and will be the prototype in their pitch to get further funding.|

## Projects
*(in progress)*
- **Royalty Loyalty:** Ruby on Rails app for the 'Stemettes' charity. Girls use it to check-in and out of events they attend and are prompted to complete surveys to earn points. The points can be exchanged for rewards and the survey answers allow the charity to measure the impact of their work.
