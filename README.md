# Gabriel Arafa

I'm a junior software developer with a passion for good practice, continuous learning and collaboration. After 5 years working as a dispatcher for the London Ambulance Service, I decided I wanted to code. I have always enjoyed problem solving and the development world struck me as an exciting place to find fulfilling work. I have since completed a 12-week bootcamp at Makers Academy and am continuing to develop my skills and immerse myself in the London tech scene.
